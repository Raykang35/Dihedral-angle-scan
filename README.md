# Dihedral-angle-scan

Dihedral angle is one crucial parameter in constructing potential energy surface 
1. Relaxed Scan
   Scan a series of different dihedral angle, relax the structure before getting the energy
2. Rigid Scan
   Scan a series of different dihedral angle without optimization structure.

Tutorial


First, optimize the molecule geometry. Using Chemdraw to create the .mol file (containing chemical structure and preliminary geometry), then using Avogadro to transfer into .xyz file.
